SVG invite widgets that look just like the ones on the Discord client!

### String guidelines
- Language codes should be in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) format
- If Discord supports the language you're adding,  strings should perfectly match the ones on the client (capitalization too!)
- [Check if your JSON is valid](https://jsonlint.com/)
