## Setting up a development environment

- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to get the development server up
- Access it through http://localhost:8080/

## String guidelines

- Language codes should be in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) format
- Languages should be in alphabetical order in the .json
- If Discord supports the language you're adding, strings should perfectly match the ones on the client (capitalization too!)
- [Check if your JSON is valid](https://jsonlint.com/)
